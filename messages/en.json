      "description2": "My name is Jeremy, I am 28 years old, and I have the privilege of sharing my life with the person who gives it meaning. I have three passions: photography, music, and skateboarding. In life, I save your most beautiful moments and create websites. The website you are currently browsing was designed by me. French is my native language, and I am fluent in English. I am also learning Swedish and hope to live there for a few years someday. I love stepping out of my comfort zone, sharing, and learning what the world has to offer.",

      "description3": "Photography is the most tangible way for me to connect with the things that matter most to me: the relationships and bonds we build throughout our lives. I believe we don't pay enough attention to what happens around us, letting fleeting moments slip by. This is why I do what I do.",
      "description4": "My goal is to capture these significant moments with the sincerity they deserve. I want these images to be beautiful and genuine, no matter the occasion. Ultimately, that's what matters most to me."
